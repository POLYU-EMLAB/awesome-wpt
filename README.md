A curated list of awesome "wireless power transfer (WPT)" resources, and shiny things. Inspired by awesome-... stuff.

## Methods
- [PEEC wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_element_equivalent_circuit) Partial element equivalent circuit method (PEEC) is partial inductance calculation used for interconnect problems from early 1970s which is used for numerical modeling of electromagnetic (EM) properties.
- [FFT PEEC](https://github.com/UniPD-DII-ETCOMP/FFT-PEEC) FFT-PEEC code for electromagnetic problems
- [PEEC 1D](https://github.com/UniPD-DII-ETCOMP/PEEC-1D) PEEC code, based on stick elements, for the solution of full-wave electromagnetic problems.

## Coil design

- [Modeling Resonant Coupled Wireless Power Transfer System](https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/ug/modeling-resonant-coupled-wireless-power-transfer-system.html) An example from MATLAB.

## System design
- [IPT-calculator](https://github.com/Wireless-power-transfer/IPT-calculator) This is an online calculator to aid in the design of inductive power transfer systems.
- [MIF3](https://github.com/JCCopyrights/MIF3) Matlab Interface For Fast Field Solvers
